Abstract


Flash ADC is also known as the parallel A/D converter. It is formed of a series of comparators, each one comparing the input signal to an unique reference voltage. The comparator outputs connect to the inputs of a priority encoder circuit built with gates and diode which then produces a binary output. Flash converters are extremely fast compared to many other types of ADCs. This paper explains the simulation of flash adc using esim.

Circuit Details





This three-bit flash ADC requires seven comparators. A four-bit version would require 15 comparators. With each additional output bit, the number of required comparators doubles. It has seven op-amps and seven Exclusive-OR gates. Vref is a stable reference voltage provided by a precision voltage regulator as part of the converter circuit and Vin is given as 5V. The Vref used here is PWL wave and its connected to non â€“ inverting terminal of the op-amp.
Methodology
Verilog code for Ex-OR Gate is created and simulated using MakerChip. The Code is dumped in Ngveri and model is created. Schematics is drawn on eSim. Generating Netlist for the mixed signal circuit. Kicad to Ngspice conversion is done by adding simulation parameters for the circuit. Simulation is done.







Software Used





eSim:

It is an Open Source EDA developed by FOSSEE, IIT Bombay. It is used for electronic circuit simulation. It is made by the combination of two software namely NgSpice and KiCAD. For more details refer: https://esim.fossee.in/home

NgSpice:

It is an Open Source Software for Spice Simulations. For more details refer: http://ngspice.sourceforge.net/docs.html

Makerchip:

It is an Online Web Browser IDE for Verilog/System-verilog/TL-Verilog Simulation. Refer https://www.makerchip.com/

Verilator:

It is a tool which converts Verilog code to C++ objects. Refer: https://www.veripool.org/verilator/
